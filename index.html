    <h1 class="title">Can Yelp Reviews predict restaurant closures?</h1>
    <p>Yelp reviews contain rich data about the place, it's ambience, star rating, photos and other factors.
      Can this data be used to predict whether a restaurant is going to close?
      Let's see.</p>
    <p>In this series of visualisations, we will walk you through some key factors that influence a restaurant's closure. We use data from Yelp reviews for restaurants in Pheonix, AZ. We will show you both open and closed restaurants to help you understand what is happening.</p>
    <section id="map-vis">
      <h2>No trends on the map</h2>
      <p>You might except to see a trend when you look at a map of the city. Maybe the restaurants closing are based more in downtown, maybe they are near an expensive location. Taking a look at the map of Pheonix below, we can't really make out a trend.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="star-ratings">
      <h2>Star ratings do not predict closure</h2>
      <p>One might expect that the restaurants that have closed are all the ones with a low star ratings. After all, when we don't like a place we leave a low rating and the restaurant loses business. However, this is not the case! Star ratings of closed restarants vary across the spectrum!</p>
    </section>
    <section id="price">
      <h2>Relative price can predict closure</h2>
      <p>One might expect that price is a good indicator for predicting closure. This is somewhat true. The absolute price DOES NOT matter. That is to say it's easually likely for an expensive and a cheap restaurant to close down. However, relative price matters (relative to it's neighbours within 1 mile radius). Thus, expensive restaurants in areas with cheaper restaurants are more likely to close. </p>

    <section id="reviews">
      <h2>Relative Review Counts can also predict closure</h2>
      <p>Relative Review Count is an indicator of the number of reviews recieved relative to the restaurant's neighbours that are within a 1 mile radius. This is a good predictor of restaurant closure. </p>

    </section>

    <section id="density-vis">
      <h2>Density of surrounding restaurants is a good predictor of closure, although not for Chinatown</h2>
      <p>What does matter is the density of restaurants. If a restaurant is in an area which a many other restaurants (ex: downtown), it has a high rate of closure. This makes sense since it faces severe competition from it's neighbours.</p>

      <p>However, there is an interesting behaviour here. If we compare restaurant density of similar restaraunts (ex: chinatown), we don't see the earlier behaviour. Our graphs change to show that if a restaurant is in an area where other similar restarants exist, it is less likely to close.</p>
